# prepaid-cards

Hi everyone and thanks for stopping by.
I'm a coursera student in the Data Science track hosted by Johns Hopkins University.
I highly recommend their courses - 9 in total.

I love research and have some data experience including SPSS, SQL, Python and Tableau. Currently adding R to my skillset and having a great time with it!
